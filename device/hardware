# Hardware Notes (MVP)

This folder documents the physical Compliance Smart Meter.

MVP scope:

- ESP32-S3 module with WiFi or similar launch computer compatible device connected via ethernet.
- Current/voltage sensing (clamp or inverter integration) as required for renewable energy output.
- Isolated power supply suitable for solar / high voltage environments.
- microSD for local buffering when offline ensuring longterm redundancy. 

Goal for this phase: finalise reference design and produce 2 manufacturable prototypes that can be deployed for use.
